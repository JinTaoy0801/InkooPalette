    <h2>Game Design Document</h2>
    <h4>By Devon Lum, Jin Tao Yu, and Kevin Wang</h4>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This document describes a game called <i>Inkoo's Palette</i>, designed to be a simple, 2D platformer, 
        constructed and documented to help others learn to make simple, 2D platformers. The game will 
        employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, platformer 
        & gravity, efficient memory management, and more basic 2D game techniques.</p>

    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p><i>Inkoo's Palette</i> will be developed for the Windows Platform using the Wolfie2D game engine, 
        which is a game engine developed by Joe Weaver and Professor Richard McKenna in Fall 2020 
        for Stony Brooks 2D game programming course as an alternative to Phaser. The game will be 
        coded in Typescript. Audacity will be used for all music and sound effects management. 
        Artwork will be drawn using Piskel.</p>

    <h3>Backstory</h3>
    <p>Once there was a painter who was beloved by colors, he who gave the world color had three disciples,
        whom he gave each a primary color. The painter wanted his disciples to venture throughout the 
        world to spread out their color evenly, so all corners of the world can be colorful. But they 
        got selfish and wanted to keep the color all to themselves. In a world absence of color, a single 
        spirit of color emerges to restore color back into the world.
        (subjective to change)</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The spirit of color, Inkoo, emerges to restore color to the world; he must defeat the three disciples 
        and restore color back to the world.</p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>This game will work like a platformer where Inkoo will be able to move left and right, and jump on platforms 
        and other surfaces. Inkoo will have attack abilities with set ranges to hit enemies.
    </p>
    <p>Inkoo would have a three part attack, where the player is rewarded if he makes it up to the third string and 
        is able to hit it before the enemies hit him back since it would deal more damage. The player is not forced 
        to do so though. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inkoo would have an unlockable dashing ability after he complete said [objective]</li>
        <li>Inkoo would have an unlockable range attack ability after he complete said [objective]</li>
        <li>Inkoo would have an unlockable double jump ability after he complete said [objective]</li>
    </ul>
